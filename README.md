This project is a final project for WDD 330. It was build as a collaboration between all of the contributors in the repo. Their personal Github accounts will be linked below.

The Cloud Shelf website is an online book shelf. With it, you are able to search for books and add them to "shelves" to keep track of what you are currently reading, what you have already read, and what you would like to read in the future. 

### How it works
Cloud Shelf uses the GoogleBooks API to allow users to search for any book. When the user finds the book that they want, they can add it to three different shelves: read, reading, or want to read. Because the site doesn't have a database, the lists of books are put in localStorage. When the user wants to see the books inside of their shelves they can visit their library.
